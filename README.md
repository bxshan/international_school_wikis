### Wikipedia for International Schools

Background:
- Wikipedia is a great source for information, as it has over 55 billion articles, over 6 billion of which are articles in English.
- As a result of all these articles, Wikipedia results often appear in search result with popular search engines, such as Google, Bing and DuckDuckGo.
- Yet these pieces information have many mistakes, often how they are rarely updated and are written in the form of an advertisement.

Goals:
- My goal is to improve and change the information in the articles so that they are more updated and less phrased as an advertisement.
- I will start in ISB, then expand to other international schools in Beijing, such as DCB, WAB, BIBA, and many more.
